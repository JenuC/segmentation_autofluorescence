## segmentation_autofluorescence
Methods to segment autofluorescence from NADH/FAD images

## test image done manually
* polygon- fast/single cell data

* threshold- fast/ grouped data

* threshold + selection slow/single cell data

Free hand drawn shapes or polygon shapes(as seen above) are commonly used to separate the cells in such images. There is a need for a better cell-segmentation method. 
## Options
I have been mitigating this problem using two methods
* get spare cell concentration biologically
* using ImageJ (combination of wand_tool, selection_tool and thresholding)

I wonder if there is already an intelligent segmentation method available to solve this problem?
