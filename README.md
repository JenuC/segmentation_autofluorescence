## segmentation_autofluorescence
Methods to segment autofluorescence from NADH/FAD images

## test image done manually
Free hand drawn shapes or polygon shapes(as seen above) are commonly used to separate the cells in such images. There is a need for a better cell-segmentation method. 
* polygon- fast/single cell data
* threshold- fast/ grouped data
* threshold + selection slow/single cell data
output of such markings looks like these:

## Options
I have been mitigating this cell-separation problem using two methods
* get spare cell concentration biologically
* using ImageJ (combination of wand_tool, selection_tool and thresholding as shown above)
as seen, manual segmentation results in unclean single cell data. I wonder if there is already an intelligent segmentation method available to solve this problem?
